    <p>sure, why not. this website is the culmination of many attempts to keep a history of myself and my work on the web. it will probably not be the last attempt either. to be brief, it is written in as pared down a way as possible. i am interested in how tools shape our lives â€” and in this case, the tool is the web browser and how it provides <a href="https://www.linedandunlined.com/archive/default-systems-in-graphic-design">defaults</a> for us to interact with.</p>
    <p>i am a graphic designer and software developer based in new york. i currently work at <a href="http://moma.org/">MoMA</a>, making the website. it is a bit more fancy than this one. i also do my own stuff. you can find a more detailed bio <a href="http://archive.eric.young.li/about">here</a>.</p>
    <p>here, you can find a somewhat complete archive of my work. i make no guarantees on updating it, but it's worth a shot. you can also find me on <a href="https://www.are.na/eric-li">are.na</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/eli8527">twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eli8527/">instagram</a>.</p>
